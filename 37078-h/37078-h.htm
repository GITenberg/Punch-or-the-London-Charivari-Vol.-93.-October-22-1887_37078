<h2>MR. PUNCH&#8217;S MANUAL FOR YOUNG RECITERS.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/181.png">
<img width="100%" src="images/181.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>As has been observed earlier in this series, the Amateur Reciter is influenced
by a natural ambition to harrow his audience to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>And, be it said, the average audience is
not at all averse to being harrowed&mdash;provided
this is done with any science and refinement.
When persons are met together
for social enjoyment, nothing apparently
affords them keener pleasure than a performance
which produces certain peculiar
sensations, such as the feeling of partial
want of control over the facial nerves,
smarting behind the eyes, increasing obstruction
in the throat, and a general conviction
that, unless something occurs to
make them laugh at once, they will be
irresistibly compelled to sob like so many
seals. It is, perhaps, a little odd&mdash;but the
taste exists, and must be taken into account.
The sole drawbacks are that, too often, the
means adopted to secure the desired result
depend more than should be upon sentiment
which might almost be described as false;
that the incidents occasionally have too little
relation to real life; and that, what might
have proved eminently touching, is marred
by some involuntary association with the
ludicrous and grotesque. In his anxiety
to preserve his pupils from such pitfalls as these, <i>Mr. Punch</i> offers an
example in which the blemishes he has hinted at have been sedulously
avoided. It is at once homely, wholesome, and tear-compelling&mdash;like the common
onion. You will find you produce a favourable impression at once by announcing
it as,&mdash;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Positively the Last Performance!</span></h3>

<p>(<i>You must come on with a general suggestion in your manner that you are
supposed to be the proprietor of an itinerant Cat and Canary Troupe.
Begin with a slow and somewhat depressed shake of the head, as if in
answer to imaginary inquirer.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>No, we ain&#8217;t performin&#8217; to-day, Sir, and the boys are all on the gape</p>
<p>At seem&#8217; the mice in mournin&#8217;, and the cats in chokers o&#8217; crape;</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m giving the Show a rest, d&#8217;ye see? for I didn&#8217;t feel up to the job,</p>
<p>(<i>Pause&mdash;then subdued</i>) For my leadin&#8217; comejian&#8217;s left me, Sir&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Explanatory, perceiving you are not understood</i>)&mdash;the
brindle kinairy&mdash;(<i>more impatiently</i>) Bob!</p>
<p>What, ye don&#8217;t remember? (<i>Surprise.</i>) Not him as wore the toonic o&#8217; Turkey red?</p>
<p>What rode in a gilded kerridge with a &#8217;at an&#8217; plumes on his &#8217;ed?</p>
<p>And, as soon as we&#8217;d taken a tanner, &#8217;ud fire a saloot from the gun?
<span class="stage">[<i>Excitedly.</i></span></p>
<p>There was Talent inside o&#8217; that bird, there was, or I never see it in one!</p>
<p>(<i>Philosophic bitterness.</i>) Well, he&#8217;s soon forgot&mdash;but I&#8217;ve often thought as a</p>
<p><i>fish</i> keeps longer than Fame!</p>
<p>(<i>Sudden comprehension and restored cordiality.</i>) Oh, ye didn&#8217;t
know him as <i>Bob</i>?... I see&mdash;no, that were his <i>private</i> name.</p>
<p>I used to announce him in public on a more long-winded-er scale&mdash;</p>
<p>I christened him &ldquo;Gineral Moultky,&rdquo; (<i>apologetically</i>)
which he <i>&#8217;ad</i> rather gone at the tail;</p>
<p>And a bird more popilar never performed on a peripathetic stage,</p>
<p>He was allers sure of a round of applause as soon as he quitted the cage!</p>
<p>For he thoroughly hentered into the part he was down for to play,</p>
<p>And he never got &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo; nor &ldquo;queered the pitch,&rdquo;&mdash;leastwise, till the hother day.</p>
<p>I thought he&#8217;d bin hoverexertin&#8217; hisself, and &#8217;ud better be out of the bill,</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t till yesterday hevenin I&#8217;d any ideer he was <i>ill</i>!</p>
<p>Then I see he was rough on the top of his &#8217;ed, and his tongue looked dry at the tip,</p>
<p>And it dawned on me like a thunderbolt&mdash;&ldquo;Great Evings!&rdquo;
I groaned,&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="sc">the Pip!</span>&rdquo;
(<i>Pause here, to emphasise the tremendous gravity of this discovery.</i>)</p>
<p>Well, I <i>&#8217;ad</i> bin trainin&#8217; a siskin to hunderstudy the part,
(<i>more ordinary tone for this</i>)</p>
<p>And I sent him on&mdash;(<i>tolerantly</i>)&mdash;which he done his best, but
he &#8217;adn&#8217;t no notion o&#8217; <i>Hart</i>!</p>
<p>So I left the pitch as soon as I could, and (meanin&#8217; to make more &#8217;aste)</p>
<p>I cut across one o&#8217; them buildin&#8217; sites as was left a runnin&#8217; to waste.</p>
<p>There was yawning pits by the flinty road, as rendered the prospeck dull,</p>
<p>And &#8217;ere and there a winderless &#8217;ouse, with the look of a grinning skull,</p>
<p>(<i>Try to paint this scene visibly for the audience; background is essential for what is to come.</i>)</p>
<p>A storm had bin &#8217;anging about all day (and it <i>broke</i>, you&#8217;ll remember, at last!)</p>
<p>So I &#8217;urried on, it was gettin&#8217; late&mdash;and the Gineral sinking fast!</p>
<p>(<i>You are now approaching the harrowing part, but keep yourself in reserve for the present.</i>)</p>
<p>But all on a sudding I &#8217;eard him give a kind of a feeble flap,</p>
<p>And I stops, and sez in a &#8217;opeful way, &ldquo;Why, you&#8217;re up in yer sterrups, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>A bold metapher applied to a bird, but characteristic in the speaker.</i>)</p>
<p>(<i>Sink your voice.</i>) Then I see by the look of his sorrowful eye he was thinkin&#8217;: &ldquo;Afore I go,</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see one performance&mdash;for the last&mdash;of the dear old Show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>Note, and make your audience feel, the touch of Nature here.</i>)</p>
<p>And I sez, with a ketch in my voice, &ldquo;You <i>shall</i>!&rdquo; and I whipped the sheet off the board,</p>
<p>I stuck up the pair o&#8217; trestles, and fastened the tightrope cord;</p>
<p>Then I propped the Gineral up in a place from which he could see the &#8217;ole,</p>
<p>And I set the tabbies a-sparring, and the mice a-climbing the pole.</p>
<p>(<i>Build up the whole scene gradually; the dreary neighbourhood,
the total absence of bystanders, the lurid
threatening sky, and the humble entertainment proceeding
in the foreground.</i>)</p>
<p>I put my company through their tricks&mdash;and they made my hold eyes dim,</p>
<p>For they never performed for no orjence like they did last night for <i>him</i>!</p>
<p>Them tabbies sparred with a science you&#8217;d &#8217;ardly expect from sich,</p>
<p>And the mouse (what usually boggles) fetched flags with never no &#8217;itch!</p>
<p>Aye, we worked the Show in that lonely place to the sound o&#8217; the mutterin&#8217; storm,</p>
<p>Right through till we come to the finish&mdash;the part <i>he</i> used to perform.</p>
<p>He was out of the cage in a minnit&mdash;egged on by puffessional pride,</p>
<p>He pecked that incompitent siskin till he made him stand o&#8217; one side!</p>
<p>Well, I felt like &#8217;aving a good cry <i>then</i>&mdash;but the time</p>
<p>&#8217;adn&#8217;t come for that,</p>
<p>So I slipped his uniform over his &#8217;ed, and tied on his little cock-hat.
<span class="stage">[<i>With great tenderness.</i></span></p>
<p>And he set in his tiny kerridge, and was drored along by the mice,</p>
<p>A-looking that &#8217;appy and pleased with hisself, I got &#8217;em to do it twice!
<span class="stage">[<i>Tone of affectionate retrospection.</i></span></p>
<p>The very tabbies they gazed on him then with their heyes dilatin&#8217; in haw,</p>
<p>As he &#8217;obbled along to the cannon, with the match in his wasted claw!</p>
<p>I never &#8217;eard that cannon afore give sech a tremenjious pop&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Solemnly.</i>) And a peal o&#8217; thunder responded, as seemed all over the shop!</p>
<p>For a second Bob stood in the lightning, so noble, and bold, and big;&mdash;</p>
<p>Then ... a stagger ... a flutter ... a broken chirp&mdash;
(<i>you can add immensely to the effect here by a little
appropriate action. Pause, and give time for a
solemn hush to fall upon the audience, then, with a
forced calm, as if you were doing violence to your
own feelings</i>)&mdash;he was orf, Sir,&mdash;(<i>a slight gulp</i>)&mdash;he&#8217;d
&#8217;opped the twig!</p>
<p>(<i>Second Pause: then more briskly, but still with strong
emotion to the close</i>)</p>
<p>So now you&#8217;ve the hexplanation of the crape round the tabbies&#8217; necks,</p>
<p>And kin understand why we close to-day &ldquo;in token of our respecks.&rdquo;</p>
  </div></div>

<hr />

<p>The time has now come for <i>Mr. Punch</i> to bid his
pupils farewell, which he does with a pleasure that he
has some reason to hope will be not unreciprocated.
During the few months over which this course has extended,
he has made it his aim to furnish the young
carpet-knight for the fray as completely as possible, and,
if the Amateur Reciter be not (as some hold) already
invulnerable, the panoply of pieces with which he has
been armed here should go far to render him so.</p>

<p>All <i>Mr. Punch</i> would ask in return is that, when any
one of his young friends is retiring, flushed with triumph,
amidst an intoxicating murmur of faint applause and
renewed conversation, after delivering some composition
of his Preceptor&#8217;s, he will not suffer himself to be completely
dazzled by success, but will remember the means
which have contributed thereto with such gratitude as
he may be able to command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Discoveries at Pompeii.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Under this heading we
read in the <i>Times</i> that four silver urns of fair size were
found, also four smaller vessels, eight open vases, four
cups ornamented with leaves, &amp;c. &ldquo;Urns&rdquo; for hot
water: &ldquo;smaller vessels,&rdquo; tea-pots; &ldquo;eight open vases,&rdquo;
sugar-basins; &ldquo;four cups,&rdquo; tea-cups, &ldquo;ornamented with
leaves,&rdquo;&mdash;very fanciful design, probably tea-leaves,&mdash;and
there we have before us &ldquo;Five o&#8217;clock Tea, as known
to the Ladies of Pompeii.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>ROBERT ON SPELLING.</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve bin informed, on such orthority
as I carnt for a moment dout, wiz.,
Professor <span class="sc">Bassingham</span> of the White
Cross Brigade, that a cumpany has
bin formed in Amerrikey to perswade
hewerybody as writes English to spell
it as I does. I never knowd afore but
what I spelt my spelling like other
littery gennelmen, but I&#8217;m told now
that I don&#8217;t, but that I spells it more
nateral like, and so it appears that
after about 2 years thinkin of it over,
the gratest Orthers in Amerrykey
has all resolved to follow my nobel
xample and do as I does, as neer as
they can git to it. So they has
formed theirselves into the &ldquo;Spelling
Reform Association,&rdquo; and has got a
Presedent, and Wise Presidents, and
a Counsel, and a Seketerry, and all
the blooming luxurys of a rich Cumpany,
and has jest published their
fust Number and charges fore shillins
for it, as I nose to my corst, cos
I&#8217;ve jest bin and bort one.</p>

<p>Well, having jest a lezzure hour or
2, I&#8217;ve bin a trying to read my noo
book, witch is suttenly to me a dear
book, but I greeves to say as I don&#8217;t
find werry much in it, as I understands.
They suttenly uses sum
werry powerful words, and sez sum
werry powerful things, and tries
their werry best to spell like me, but
I don&#8217;t think as I can troothfully say
as they always suckeeds. They spels
<i>hed</i> like me, and <i>helth</i>, and <i>dropt</i>, and
<i>enuf</i>; but who ever seed me use sitch
words as <i>thru</i>, or <i>cof</i>, or <i>thuro</i>, or
<i>tuf</i>, or <i>ughly</i>?</p>

<p>Professor <span class="sc">Chadband</span>, L.L.D., says
that &ldquo;our senseless spelling makes
him ashamed of his language, and yet
thru habit he continues it.&rdquo; <span class="sc">David
D. Field</span>, L.L.D., of New York,
talks of our Nobel English Tung
&ldquo;being disfigured,&rdquo; and says I ought
to be haild as a deliverer!</p>

<p>Professor <span class="sc">Hadley</span> says, &ldquo;our language
is shockingly speld.&rdquo; Lord
<span class="sc">Lytton</span> says, &ldquo;it is a lying round-about
puzl-heded delusion!&rdquo; and our
own heloqwent Sir <span class="sc">C. E. Trevelyan</span>,
K.C.B., says, &ldquo;it is a labyrinth, a
chaos, an absurdity, and a disgrace!&rdquo;
and the Hedditer of the book winds it
all up by saying that &ldquo;it is the wurst
there is!&rdquo; Poor old English Langwidge!
I ony wonders how <span class="sc">Shakespear</span>
and <span class="sc">Milton</span>, and <span class="sc">Burns</span>
managed to get on with it, tho suttenly
<span class="sc">Burns</span> was a dredful bad speller.
Why he used to spell &ldquo;who&rdquo; <i>wha</i>,
and &ldquo;have&rdquo; <i>hae</i>, and &ldquo;whom&rdquo;
<i>wham</i>! But then he was only a
poor plowman, and not an Hed
Waiter. I of coarse little thort wen
I fust commenced my umbel efforts
to instruckt and enliten the world
with skimmings from my daily dairy,
that I shood ever be held up to the
admirashun and gratitood of English
mankind as a deliverer of our nobel
English Tung from its many defecks,
but I of course acceps the
pursishun, and, I ope, with becoming umility, and if the Spelling Reform Association chooses, as
seems ony nateral, to elect me as one of their Wice Presidents, with a nice cumferal little salary
paid quarterly, in adwance, I shall not at all object to become also one of their regular
contribbuters, or ewen to hedit sum of their harticles as is really not quite hup to the mark in the
spelling line.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="sc">F. J. Child</span>, P.D., L.H.D., cums it rayther
strong when he says, &ldquo;Sum hav a religious
aw, and sum hay an erth-born passion for our establisht spelling. I don&#8217;t much care how anybody
spells, so he spels different from that.&rdquo; But praps one of the werry greatest staggerers in my four-shilling
staggering book, is what the Heditter says, wiz., &ldquo;A filologist who should uphold our present
mode of spelling, would be like an astronomer who should teach that the Erth is based on a Turtl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s about the most wunderfullest sentense as ewen a Hedhitter ever wrote, and
they does sumtimes cum out with a startler or 2. Fust with regard to the spelling. As I don&#8217;t in
the least know what a Filologist means I carnt of course say much as to that, but if there is one
mortal thing in this butiful world of ours as I does know sumthink about, I should think as all

<h2>THE LETTER-BAG OF TOBY, M.P.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">From a Young Man Still in the Country.</span></p>

<p class="author"><i>Eaton Hall, Saturday.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:54%;"><a href="images/184.png">
<img width="100%" src="images/184.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Toby</span>,&mdash;I write to you from here
where I stay a day or two on my way
to Dublin. I expect by the time it
reaches you I will be installed in the
Chief Secretary&#8217;s Lodge, and the
National League may prepare to sit
up. I have been spending a week or
two very agreeably in Scotland, a little
out of the way of letters or newspapers.
I am told there has been quite a
demand for me, a sort of popular outcry
that I should forthwith proceed to
Ireland. This is, of course, not unflattering.
It indicates a general
belief which I, for one, am not disposed
to contest, that if Ireland is to be
saved, I&#8217;m the man to do it. That&#8217;s
all very well; but it is, doncha know,
something of a boah to be thus
bothered at a time when one had two
or three pleasant engagements on
hand. It used to be just the same in the House last Session. If I did not really
live there, entering with the Mace and the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, and leaving only at the cry
of &ldquo;Who goes home?&rdquo; there were impetuous protests. I put in <span class="sc">King-Harman</span>
at Question time, but they wouldn&#8217;t have him. Often, as I lay on the sofa in
the Chief Secretary&#8217;s room, looking over <i>Punch</i>, or reading the proofs of the
forthcoming new edition of my <i>Defence of Philosophic Doubt</i>, I have heard the
distant growls of the Irish Members when <span class="sc">King-Harman</span> rose to answer a
question addressed to me. Quite touching this personal attachment. At the
same time a little embarrassing.</p>

<p>Now I am really going to Dublin, and shall spend a cheerful November there.
<span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, in his genial way, has tried to make things pleasant by reminding
me that from the drawing-room window of the Chief Secretary&#8217;s Lodge I can see
the place where poor <span class="sc">Freddy Cavendish</span> fell. &ldquo;They&#8217;re sure to take a pot shot
at you,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but you&#8217;re all right. Unless a man can make sure of hitting
a lamp-post at fifty paces, it will be no use his trying to bring you down.&rdquo;
A nice companionable man <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>. Always tries to say something pleasant.
But really I don&#8217;t pay much attention to his kindly apprehensions. I shall
be boahed, I daresay; but not by the passage of a bullet, or the thrust of a knife.</p>

<p>People evidently expect great things to follow on my arrival in Dublin. To
the accident of my holiday absence in Scotland they attribute all the failures of
the Executive. &ldquo;If <span class="sc">Balfour</span> had been there,&rdquo;
they say, &ldquo;<span class="sc">W. O&#8217;Brien</span> would now
be comfortably in gaol and T. D. S., Lord Mayor, would be laid by the heels.&rdquo;
I weally don&#8217;t know. Fact is, I have not closely followed up affairs either in the
newspapers or despatches. There have been some rows, I understand. But that
is not unusual in Ireland. Where people are right in kindly looking to me to
restore peace and order in Ireland is in the supposition that I have a plan.
That is true, though I cannot claim personal and private property in it. Fact
is the plan is <span class="sc">Cromwell&#8217;s</span>. It worked admirably when originally put in practice,
and I do not see any reason why it should fail now. There are, of course, difficulties
in the way; prejudice to be overcome, legal forms to be dealt with, and
that sort of thing. There is also, next Session of Parliament to be met, and
awkward questions by <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> and the rest. But they need not think to
intimidate me by such reflections. I shall put up <span class="sc">King-Harman</span> to answer all
inconvenient questions. Besides, it is exceedingly probable that in the full
development of my plan the Irish Members who last Session distinguished themselves
by &ldquo;wanting to know&rdquo; will be unavoidably absent from their places. It
is an awful nuisance breaking in upon a man&#8217;s holiday; but it is a difficulty
that has to be faced, and as there seems a popular inclination to look to me to
settle it, I suppose there is nothing to be done but to grapple with it.</p>

<p>One additional drawback from a quite unexpected
source makes itself known by correspondence with my
colleagues. They are all in a dreadful state of fussy
alarm. My uncle the Markiss begs me to be careful.
&ldquo;Firmness without Rashness&rdquo; is an excellent copy-head,
which <span class="sc">W. H. Smith</span> sends me in fine round-hand
from the distant Mediterranean. I wish they&#8217;d all mind
their own affairs. In the intervals of my other occupations
I can answer for Ireland, and if any awkwardness
arises, I can put up <span class="sc">King-Harman</span> to answer for me.
So, dear <span class="sc">Toby</span>, don&#8217;t you have any anxiety on my
account. Some half-hour after dinner, with the contemplative
toothpick at hand, and my heels on the table, I
will, if the subject occurs to me, settle the Irish Question.</p>

<h2>BIG WORK AND LITTLE HANDS.</h2>

<p>That a child prodigy should have been able twice last
week to fill St. James&#8217;s Hall to overflowing, may not perhaps
speak at the first glance very highly for the artistic instincts
of the British Public, who, as a thoughtful musical critic
remarks in the pages of a contemporary, are sometimes
&ldquo;more impressed by a little boy in an Eton jacket than
by the finest music that might be played in less exciting
circumstances;&rdquo; still it cannot be denied that the couple
of recitals referred to, given by Master <span class="sc">Josef Hofmann</span>,
were altogether two exceptionally brilliant performances.
Commenting, however, on the little fellow&#8217;s efforts to give
a good rendering of a slow movement, the critic already
alluded to asks how, in a long-drawn melody which is a
matter of passion and of feeling, &ldquo;a child of eleven can
have much feeling or any passion?&rdquo; Surely this is
hypercriticism. Ask any boy of eleven who has had a
whipping, or has come off second best in a fight with his
little sister, whether he hasn&#8217;t much feeling;&mdash;and as for
passion! Well: but, perhaps this is not exactly what
the critic means. Nevertheless, he proceeds rather
pertinently to ask whether this singularly gifted
young artist will be suffered, &ldquo;when he has served the
immediate purposes of those who have control over him,
to continue his studies in a rational manner and far from
the fierce light and the hot-house temperature pertaining
to the concert platform?&rdquo; As Master <span class="sc">Josef Hofmann</span> is
already booked for an American tour, there does not seem
any prospect of this highly desirable consummation, at
least in the near future. Judging, therefore, from little
Master <span class="sc">Josef&#8217;s</span> present arrangements, one would be disposed
to apostrophise him sympathetically in the language
of Dr. <span class="sc">Watts</span>, and say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Night after night, you&#8217;ll prove a sight</p>
<p class="i2">To draw the cute Yankee,</p>
<p>Because your little hands were made</p>
<p class="i2">To stretch from C to C!&rdquo;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Still, as he is an unquestionable genius who has a
future before him, it is to be hoped that he won&#8217;t be
&ldquo;worked out&rdquo; early at high pressure, and stimulated by
a success that will only blunt his powers by depriving
him of that desire for true progress in his art by which
alone they can be legitimately developed. &ldquo;Not too much
gaslight, some practice, and plenty of battledore and
shuttlecock,&rdquo; is the proper <i>recipe</i> for little Master <span class="sc">Josef</span>.
With this he can&#8217;t go wrong, and will, without doubt,
if he stick to it, command the musical world of the
future as surely as he has astonished that of to-day.</p>

<h2>SHOWS VIEWS.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By Victor Who-goes-Everywhere.</i></p>

<div class="figright" style="width:24%;"><a href="images/185.png">

<p>THE suggestion made a month ago by a &ldquo;Salubrity Abroad,&rdquo; (now
happily a &ldquo;Salubrity at home&rdquo;) that the above title would make a
good heading for an all-round-about theatrical and entertainment
article in <i>Mr. Punch&#8217;s</i> pages, is
at length carried out. In the character
of a hero conquering difficulties,
I have been here, there,
and everywhere. My first triumph
was at the Gaiety Theatre, where
(after surmounting all obstruction)
I secured a place from whence
<i>Miss Esmeralda</i> could be watched
in comfort. This piece is called a
&ldquo;melodramatic burlesque,&rdquo; in
two Acts, but I confess I failed to
distinguish either the melodrama
or the burlesque. It was, however,
well mounted with good scenery
and pretty dresses. It had further
the advantage of an excellent
stage-manager in Mr. <span class="sc">Charles
Harris</span>, and a no less excellent
dance inventor in Mr. <span class="sc">John
D&#8217;Auban</span>, but of the book the less that is said the better. Frankly,
it is not amusing. This being the case I was not surprised to find
the names of its authors printed in the programme in a type just
half the size accorded to the style and title of &ldquo;the producer.&rdquo; The
acting calls for no particular comment. Mr. <span class="sc">Lonnen</span> sings an Irish
song excellently well, but is less diverting when he trusts to
attitudinising as a provocative to merriment. Miss <span class="sc">Marion Hood&#8217;s</span>
charming face is sweeter than her voice, and Miss <span class="sc">Fannie Leslie&#8217;s</span>
singing is as welcome now as ever it was&mdash;it recalls many a
vocal triumph of the past. Mr. <span class="sc">George Stone</span> as <i>Gringoire</i> is more
broadly comic than Mr. <span class="sc">Beerbohm Tree</span> in a somewhat similar <i>rôle</i>
in the <i>Ballad Monger</i>. Both the Misses <span class="sc">Blanche</span> are all that
could be desired in two subordinate characters. In the last Act there
is a &ldquo;Pyramid Ballet,&rdquo;&mdash;which is slightly perplexing. Until my
attention was pointedly called to the fact that I was watching a
terpischorean demonstration of a game of billiards, I was under the
impression that some of the intricacies of the plot of <span class="sc">Victor Hugo&#8217;s</span>
<i>Notre Dame</i> were being very cleverly explained to me in easily
followed dumb show. Perhaps the best thing (barring the Irish song)
in the whole piece is an ingenious dance of Warders and Prisoners in
Scene I., Act 2. In alluding to the list of the company I should not
have forgotten to say that the names of that admirable comedian
Mr. <span class="sc">H. Leslie</span> and that evergreen queen of burlesque, Miss <span class="sc">E. Farren</span>,
are conspicuous by their absence. In spite of this very serious drawback,
no doubt Miss <i>Esmeralda</i> will be as successful as it deserves to
be. The scenery, dresses, and music, are alone worth a visit. And
when I say this I leave out the acting, the singing and the dancing.</p>

<p>I also went to the Royal Aquarium the other afternoon, and witnessed
the performances of a troupe of genuine Russian Wolves. If I <i>had</i> to
appear in public myself with a company of performing animals, I think
I should prefer poodles, or white mice, though, as a spectacle, wolves
are undoubtedly more thrilling. I don&#8217;t know that these particular
wolves did much; but the really striking fact, of course, was their
condescension in doing anything, and it was certainly &ldquo;pretty to
see&rdquo; them jumping a gate, and arranging themselves picturesquely
on chairs, with just sufficient display of grinning jaws to make the
audience congratulate themselves that the stage was fenced round
by temporary iron railings. The creatures are evidently deeply
attached to the Professor, who has so ably prepared them for public
life. I was convinced of this by the effusion with which one after
another advanced and kissed his forehead, on receiving a slight hint
to that effect from a whip. But to be kissed&mdash;however tenderly&mdash;by
a wolf, must be a creepy sensation. On the occasion when I was
present we were afforded an additional, and I may say an unrehearsed,
sensation after the act-drop fell. There was a scurry behind, a
shout, and then&mdash;a great jagged rent in the curtain. People in the
front row of stalls looked uncomfortable&mdash;it did seem very much as
if one of the wolves had determined to &ldquo;take a call&rdquo; on his own
account, but it was merely a little mishap with one of the railings.
However, there was no real cause for alarm in any case, for an
audience would have had ample time to escape while the wolf was
amusing himself with the orchestra, which, fortunately, is a
remarkably good one.</p>

<p>After the Wolves, by way of contrast, I paid a visit to La Belle
<span class="sc">Fatma</span>. On delivery of a shilling, I, with other members of the Public,
was passed in to a screened-off portion of the Imperial Theatre. A
stout French gentleman seated himself at a piano below the stage,
and the curtain rose presently, disclosing the fair <span class="sc">Fatma</span> and her
troupe seated in a row, like a new variety of Christy Minstrels.
With regard to the principal lady, I am bound to say that her
charms did not seem to me to have been at all overestimated, and her
portraits upon the posters actually do her less than justice. But
this is a matter of opinion; and I must confess that, after all, it
was not upon the peerless <span class="sc">Fatma</span> that my eyes were most riveted.
There was a stout old lady in a turban, two places from her&mdash;<i>such</i>
an old lady! with immense black eyebrows, meeting over flashing
dark eyes, and a massive Oriental nose, a wide sternly compressed
mouth, and three chins. Upon her knees she held a gourd-shaped
drum, which she smacked severely at intervals; she might have sat
for <span class="sc">Cornelia</span> polishing one of her &ldquo;jewels&rdquo;; and when she sang,
the illusion was complete!</p>

<p>As to the performance, it was Oriental; and no description can
convey much more. We had an Overture on the familiar &ldquo;Rum-tum-tum,
tum-a-tum-tum-tum, tum-a-tum&rdquo; theme, which revealed
considerable &ldquo;staying power&rdquo; on both sides of the footlights.
Then one member of the <i>troupe</i> after another advanced, and, if a
lady, <i>chassé</i>&#8217;d and revolved with slowly waving arms, and an expression
that seemed to imply that she would take more pains if it
were only worth while; if a man, he capered and grinned and shouted
in a manner which, at all events, infinitely amused the performer
himself. While this was going on, the old lady continued to
&ldquo;spank&rdquo;&mdash;there really is no better term for it&mdash;her drum in a sort
of grim <i>rêverie</i>, and a young person by her side emitted piercing
shrieks by way of enlivening the proceedings. There was a mysterious
One on the stage, who reminded me of an immense dice-box
muffled in muslin; this, it turned out, was the <span class="sc">Colossus</span> of <span class="sc">Sousse</span>,
to whom was entrusted the function of &ldquo;presenting&rdquo; Mademoiselle
<span class="sc">Fatma</span> at the close of the performance. This seemed superfluous,
particularly as the excellent Colossus had no notion of doing more
than taking her by the hand and stalking two paces forward. It
was all over in a quarter of an hour or so; and, for my own part, I
considered the old lady in the turban alone worth the paltry shilling
charged for admission.</p>

<p>I have also been to <span class="sc">Terry&#8217;s</span> Theatre, where great precautions are
taken to prevent fire. Everything, more or less, is labelled &ldquo;Exit,&rdquo;
and, instead of doors, in several parts of the house there are curtains.
On the whole it must be a good theatre to escape from. This is
worth noting, if the performances are wearisome.</p>

<h2>JOE&#8217;S JAUNT.</h2>

<p><i>Off to Ireland!</i>&mdash;At last. <span class="sc">Collings</span> with me, of course:&mdash;rather grumpy,
because <span class="sc">Salisbury&#8217;s</span> got the credit of passing the Allotments Bill, instead of
himself. Still, <span class="sc">Jesse</span> better than nobody. Would create bad impression to visit
Belfast without an <i>entourage</i>.</p>

<p><i>In Steamer.</i>&mdash;Look up my Irish History&mdash;or rather, <span class="sc">Jesse&#8217;s</span> Irish History,
which he&#8217;s borrowed from Birmingham Free Library. An Alderman <i>can</i> do
that sort of thing. Also examine revolver. Not accustomed to carrying one.
What is the best place for it? <span class="sc">Jesse</span> says, &ldquo;left-hand coat-tail pocket,
decidedly, because then you can whip it out in a twinkling.&rdquo; <span class="sc">Jesse&#8217;s</span> confidence
contagious&mdash;he talks as if he had always been in the habit of &ldquo;whipping-out&rdquo;
revolvers, like a cow-boy,&mdash;or a &ldquo;three-acres-and-a-cow-boy.&rdquo; Do as he advises.
Very uncomfortable feeling. Sit down on revolver in a moment of
forgetfulness, and nearly blow Captain&#8217;s head off. Captain irritated. Asks me
for &ldquo;ransom.&rdquo; Ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>Belfast.</i>&mdash;No end of a reception. Drive through the principal streets.
Enthusiastic populace insist on taking horses out of carriage and pulling it
themselves. Gratifying, but should feel safer with the horses. Why <i>will</i> <span class="sc">Collings</span>
bow? I&#8217;m the person to bow, obviously. Bad taste, but don&#8217;t like to
stop him. Believe the mob <i>take</i> him for me&mdash;or why do they cheer him so?</p>

<p><i>At Hotel.</i>&mdash;Just found out reason of enthusiasm evoked by appearance of
<span class="sc">Jesse</span>. <i>He&#8217;s got on an Orange tie!</i> Ask him, reproachfully, why he did this?
Pretends it was a mere accident&mdash;forgot that orange was favourite Ulster colour.
Don&#8217;t want a religious riot, so make him take it off. <span class="sc">Jesse</span> getting grumpier.
Can&#8217;t help it.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;Before going to meeting, had better find out what Belfast chiefly
famous for. Ask <span class="sc">Collings</span>. Replies &ldquo;linen-shirts and handkerchiefs.&rdquo; Try
to put him in good humour by remarking that &ldquo;<i>he</i> seems shirty.&rdquo; Is there no
other historical fact connected with place? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replies, &ldquo;visit of Lord
<span class="sc">Randolph Churchill</span>.&rdquo; Wish he hadn&#8217;t mentioned latter event. Dispiriting.
Reminds one of proposed National Party, with self and <span class="sc">Randolph</span> as sole leaders&mdash;and
sole followers, too, it seems.</p>

<p><i>At Hotel&mdash;after Speech.</i>&mdash;Great success. Felt horribly inclined to start
another Home Rule plan&mdash;my fifth&mdash;but fortunately refrained. Instead of
dismemberment of Empire, I offered more Members to
Ulster. Ulster people saw the justice of this arrangement
at once. Told &#8217;em there were &ldquo;two Irelands.&rdquo;
Isn&#8217;t one Ireland enough, however?</p>

<p><i>Coleraine.</i>&mdash;A triumphal arch, with &ldquo;Welcome to
English Peasant Emancipators&rdquo; on it. Stupid to bracket
<span class="sc">Collings</span> with me in this way. Receive threatening
letter. Reminds me of my revolver. <span class="sc">Jesse</span> examines
it with the air of a professional gunsmith, critically.
Appears quite hurt at its condition; says, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve sat on
it so often he doubts if it would go off now,&rdquo; and recommends
my carrying a &ldquo;bowie-knife&rdquo; instead. Am
surprised at <span class="sc">Jesse&#8217;s</span> acquaintance with deadly weapons.
Ask him what historical event took place at Coleraine.
Says he doesn&#8217;t know and doesn&#8217;t care. But what&#8217;s he
here for except to keep me posted up in local details?
Hint to him that &ldquo;I hope I may be able to offer him
post of President of Local Government Board in my
future Ministry.&rdquo; Replies (rudely, I think) that &ldquo;he&#8217;ll
wait till I&#8217;m asked to form one.&rdquo; <i>Query</i>&mdash;doesn&#8217;t air
of Ulster exercise demoralising effect on English politicians?
Is this the &ldquo;Ulster Custom&rdquo; one&#8217;s heard so
much about? <span class="sc">Randolph</span> a case in point.</p>

<p><i>Back again.</i>&mdash;Coleraine speech excellent, though I say
it, as shouldn&#8217;t. Cheered to the echo. So was <span class="sc">Jesse</span>,
hang him! Shan&#8217;t take <i>him</i> to Canada with me. Now
for a study of the habits of deep-sea fish in the pages of
a Natural Science Primer.</p>

<h2>BOGEY IN BOND STREET.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Legend of the Grosvenor Gallery.</i>)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:65%;"><a href="images/190.png">
<img width="100%" src="images/190.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>The Spirit of Art glided through the streets of Modern London, seeking a resting-place.
She entered the Diploma Gallery of the Royal Academy, but hurried away,
affrighted at some of the terrible examples of the illustrious Forty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these are the greatest English painters!&rdquo; she murmured&mdash;&ldquo;the countrymen of
<span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>, <span class="sc">Milton</span>, and <span class="sc">Addison</span>,
<span class="sc">Tennyson</span>, <span class="sc">Macaulay</span>, and <span class="sc">Dickens</span>! How is it
that Painting cannot keep pace with Literature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It sounded like a Conundrum, and the Spirit of Art was not good at Conundrums. So
she gave it up. Then she passed into other Exhibitions&mdash;there were quite a dozen in
the neighbourhood at the very least. But she was unsatisfied, and came away. She
paused, and considered. The Spirit of Art had one great English friend (of Irish extraction),
who was a Musician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Arthur</span> is a clever fellow,&rdquo;
said the Spirit of Art to herself&mdash;there was no one else
to speak to&mdash;&ldquo;and if he <i>does</i> compose more comic Operas than Oratorios, it is, I suppose,
because there is a greater demand for the former than the latter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this it will be seen the Spirit of Art had, on the whole, a good head for business.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued the Representative of the Beautiful, &ldquo;I distinctly recollect that the
words to one of the songs of my friend <span class="sc">Arthur</span> contained a pointed reference to the
Greenery Yallery Gallery. I fancy, from all I
have heard, that the sort of thing I want will
be found in the Greenery Yallery Gallery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was quite pleased at the notion. To tell
the truth the Spirit of Art was rather weary
of perambulating the streets of London&mdash;not
even the advertisements of <span class="sc">Buffalo Bill</span> on
the hoardings gave her lasting satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me consider,&rdquo; she said, as she hovered
on the threshold of the Grosvenor Gallery,
&ldquo;now I shall find myself amongst the grandest
works of Mister <span class="sc">Jones</span>. I am never tired of
that pale face with the pointed chin&mdash;no more
is Mister <span class="sc">Jones</span>. This frequently-reproduced
portrait of a lady is most interesting. No
doubt it is a study of a chronic case of
dyspepsia that must have lasted for twenty
years. Then I shall see the choicest works
of <span class="sc">More</span> and <span class="sc">Millais</span>, and <span class="sc">Watts</span>, and oh,
joy! of Sir <span class="sc">Coutts-Lindsay</span>! This is indeed
the very spot for a resting-place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Spirit of Art glided up the staircase
and into the Grosvenor Gallery. For a moment
she was puzzled. There was no dyspeptic lady&mdash;&ldquo;no
greenery&rdquo; and very little &ldquo;yallery.&rdquo;
Then she shivered, for on all sides she found
immense pictures of battles and executions
ghastly beyond description.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what are these?&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catalogue, Miss?&rdquo; replied a civil attendant.
&ldquo;Thank you, Miss,&mdash;sixpence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the Spirit of Art read that such
and such a picture represented a dreadful defeat,
that a pestilent hospital, yonder one a
scene of torture. She found representations of
war treated in the most prosaic and unbeautiful
form.</p>

<p>She was horrified and fainted!</p>

<p>Then the vision, before her became more and
more terrible and the entire contents of the
Catalogue was unfolded before her. Dying
soldiers defying vultures, mutilated Russians
lying in an open grave, old men being blown
from the guns! Wounds, and fire, and blood!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>When she came to herself she hurried away.
She thought it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must gradually accustom myself to less
horrible things,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I will begin
at once. If I were not to do this by degrees,
I should go mad!&rdquo; She called a hansom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where to, Miss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Marylebone Road,&rdquo; cried the Spirit
of Art&mdash;in these days the Spirit is a very self-assertive
young person, and not at all like an
unprotected female&mdash;&ldquo;Baker Street Station,
Marylebone Road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she threw away her Catalogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see something less repulsive than
this&mdash;I must gradually resume my normal condition.
Something less repulsive! I have it!
I will begin with the figures of Madame <span class="sc">Tussaud&#8217;s</span>&mdash;in
the Chamber of Horrors!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAIRS TO MEND.</h2>

<p>Congregation at Oxford, having (in an
empty House), for the sake of economy, turned
the old Professorship of Anglo-Saxon into
one of English Literature, and having, with a
view to utilising its salary, entirely suppressed
the chair of Poetry, it is rumoured that the
Hebdomadal Council have already in contemplation
a sweeping list of curtailments in the
same direction.</p>

<p>The Professorships of Arabic, Archæology,
Astronomy, Botany, Celtic, Chemistry, and
Chinese, will, it is said, also be rolled into one.</p>

<p>It is hoped that, by some spirited reforms in
the direction indicated above, the University
that, from the fashion in which it has dealt
with the Chair of Poetry, appears indeed to be
out at elbows, may survive the financial crisis
in which it is evidently involved.</p>

<h2>CHANNEL TALK.</h2>

<p><i>Arranged for the use of
the returning British
Passenger at Breakfast-time.
By a very Dyspeptic
Contributor.</i></p>

<p>It is a glorious thing
to think that one is
leaving France and all
foreign kickshaws behind
one, and is once
more approaching dear
honest old England on
the deck of a British
steamer.</p>

<p>But let us come into
the cabin and have a
bit of breakfast before
we get in.</p>

<p>Surely that table
covered with a dirty
sheet instead of a tablecloth
is not prepared for
our repast?</p>

<p>Why, this stale
loaf must have been on
board quite a week.</p>

<p>It has evidently made
several passages backwards
and forwards in
company with this extremely
remarkable
sample of butter.</p>

<p>Why does this coffee
the Steward has just
brought us look like
ink and sawdust, and
taste like something
perplexing?</p>

<p>The Frenchman, who
has been expecting <i>déjeuner
à la fourchette</i>,
is surveying with astonishment
the dish of
mutton-chops they have
set down before him.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that
they are all two inches
thick, and are underdone
when cut.</p>

<p>I wonder whether he
is thinking, as I am, of
the clean, fresh, and
trim <i>restaurant</i> table,
the excellent <i>café au
laít, petits-pains</i>, Normandy
butter, and other
&ldquo;foreign kickshaws,&rdquo;
that he has just left behind
him in France.</p>

<p>Though he has had to
pay three shillings for
his hot breakfast, he
has informed me that
he will wait till he arrives,
and take &ldquo;<i>le
lunch</i>&rdquo; on shore.</p>

<p>I wonder whether he
is aware that, if he
makes this meal at the
typical Refreshment-Room,
he will have to
content himself with
stale sponge-cakes, the
day-before-yesterday&#8217;s
buns, and small tins of
lemon-drops.</p>

<p>But let us get out of
the Cabin. I certainly
prefer the deck of an
excellent steamer to the
arrangements made for
providing one with
breakfast down below.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ne Plus Ulster.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
seems to find the heart of the Irish Question in Ulster. Does he expect
to find its solution there? He appears to set little store by the wishes of those not inconsiderable portions of
Ireland which, as he says, &ldquo;do not form a portion of the Ulster plantation.&rdquo;
All other parts, even of the favoured province, &ldquo;though geographically part of Ulster,
are not parts of what we know as political Ulster.&rdquo; This certainly
narrows the Irish Question. But does it simplify it? We have all heard of those who are &ldquo;more Irish
than the Irishmen themselves.&rdquo; Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> seems to be more Ulsterish than
the men of Ulster, though they, to be sure, on his own showing, are virtually English and Scotch.
In declining to look beyond Ulster, it may be asked whether he looks into the Irish Question at all.
Altogether Irish&mdash;very!</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>The Danvers Jewels</i>, published by <span class="sc">Richard
Bentley and Son</span>, and written by an anonymous
author who dedicates the work to his
sister &ldquo;<span class="sc">Di</span>,&rdquo; (from whom he received some
assistance in the story, otherwise he would
&ldquo;never have said &lsquo;<span class="sc">Di</span>&rsquo;&rdquo;) is a short and
well-told sensational novelette in a shilling
volume. There is a genuine vein of humour
running through it, which is so artistically
managed as at first to escape the reader&#8217;s
attention, who becoming more and more irritated
with the stupidity of the supposed
narrator, gradually discovers that the story
which is being recounted by a middle-aged
Indian Colonel, who prides himself on being
remarkably astute, and on possessing a perfectly
marvellous insight into character, is
being recounted by a conceited, shallow-pated
old ass. I think it a fault that at the very
last, by some such accident as being in an
assize town and being invited to sit on the
bench, he does not see the villain thoroughly
unmasked, placed in the dock, and condemned
to death, or at least penal servitude for life.
The story, excellent as it is, seems to me to
want this finish. By the way, why, for no
conceivable purpose, quote on the title-page
a line from the Old Testament which, as every
one remembering its context and after reading
the book must see, has no apparent bearing
on the subject? Mistake this.</p>

&ldquo;Ho! Ho! Ho! and a bottle of rum,&rdquo; in
<i>Treasure Island</i>. Then there is one line in
&ldquo;Q.&#8217;s&rdquo; story, &ldquo;And here a strange thing
happened,&rdquo; which must call to mind Mr.
<span class="sc">Rider Haggard&#8217;s</span> patent of &ldquo;and now a
strange thing happened.&rdquo; &ldquo;Q.&rdquo;&mdash;rious coincidence,
isn&#8217;t it? But a &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; is
not likely to annoy Mr. <span class="sc">Haggard</span>.</p>

<p>In the first part the most impatient reader
will find that he cannot afford to skip a couple
of lines without detriment to the narrative,
but in the second part he may skip handfuls,
as the lovemaking is common-place, and
time is wasted over the tragedy which is
written by one of the heroes, and over the
description of their life in London. But on
the other hand the scene in the gambling-house
is exciting and artistically worked up,&mdash;and
coming immediately after this, the lovemaking
is uncommonly tame,&mdash;and the scene
at the Theatre is also very good, but after
this there is a lull in the excitement until
the end approaches, when there is one very
strong situation. But the actual finish is
weak. So the summing up is that the first
part is first-rate, and the second part is, on
the whole, second-rate. But who is &ldquo;Q.&rdquo;?</p>

<p>That is the Q. and what is the A.? <i>Deadman&#8217;s
Rock</i> is not a good book for very
nervous persons or children: for the latter
<i>Almond Rock</i> would be far preferable.</p>

</a><p>A Simple Clearance under Protest.</p></div>

<p>We learn from a report of the proceedings
of the City Commissioners of Sewers
last week, that
those vigilant
protectors of the
health of our
ancient City had
before them a
case that fairly
puzzled them,
and in its
strangeness and
difficulty would
probably have
puzzled even a
more judicial body than they probably pretend
to be. It would seem that they had
received a note of warning from the eminent
firm of <span class="sc">Francis Peek &amp; Co.</span>, that a large
parcel of tea was about to be submitted to
public auction which was &ldquo;simple filth,&rdquo;
and utterly unfit for consumption.</p>

<p>A Commissioner stated that he was present
at the Sale that morning, and that the whole
quantity, consisting of 1000 Chests, had been
sold, duty paid (it must have been cleared
at the Custom House with or without protest),
at one halfpenny per pound! The
natural expectation was that the &ldquo;simple
filth&rdquo; as it had been termed by experts,
would be at once seized by the officials and
destroyed, but this strange difficulty arose.
The Medical Officer of Health stated that he
had analyzed a sample of the tea in question,
and could not swear before a Magistrate
that it was unfit for use! He stated too, as
a specimen of the wisdom of our legislators,
that, by Act of Parliament, Tea was specially
exempted from the operations of Public
Analysts! So the willing Commissioners
found themselves powerless to act, but referred
the whole matter to their Sanitary
Committee, who, we understand, will at their
next meeting take tea, instead of luncheon,
made from the remains of the sample, and
report the result.</p>

<p>In the meantime <i>Mr. Punch</i>, ever ready to
assist in a good cause, dispatched one of his
City young men to make further inquiries,
who reported that he had visited the Auction
Mart on three successive days at lunch-time,
and had asked one or two of the sharpest-looking
of the crowd, as possible purchasers
of the wondrous tea, to lunch with him,
which they had willingly done; but, although
he says he lunched them copiously, they one
and all denied any knowledge of the tea
sale in question.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
